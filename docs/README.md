# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview
This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documentation. These docs describe how we initiate, plan, execute, release, and improve projects — giving teams a consistent, discoverable way to run and hand off work.

OctoAcme’s approach emphasizes:
- Customer-first thinking and measurable outcomes
- Iterative delivery and small, testable increments
- Clear ownership (PM, Product Lead, Developers, QA)
- Data-informed decisions and continuous improvement
- Documented risks, communication cadence, and playbooks

## Quick Process Summary
- Initiation: Create a one-pager to confirm problem, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and a go/no-go for planning.
- Planning: Prioritize backlog, estimate, define the Definition of Done, and identify dependencies and risks.
- Execution & Tracking: Use a project board, small PRs, CI gating, daily standups, and weekly delivery syncs to track progress.
- Release & Deployment: Meet pre-release requirements, run smoke tests, use automated pipelines, and document rollback plans.
- Retrospective & Improvement: Run retrospectives after sprints/releases/incidents and convert action items into backlog work.
